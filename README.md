"Fall into the void? Don't die or be teleported, get thrown back up!"

## Getting started

### Commands
```
/svoid reload - Reloads the configuration file
/svoid list - Lists the current duration/amplifier/height values
```

### Configuration
```
# Duration: How long the potion effect will last for. This will take some editing per the height of your spawn
# Amp: What amplifier should we use? 1 brings them up slow, 50 throws em back up! 
# yHeight: At which height should we activate the levitation? (0 = void) 

duration: 35
amp: 50
yheight: 0
```
